# Influentials

## Description

Our designer has provided a gorgeous design in the tool [Framer X](https://framer.com/) that represents a marketplace overview of our venture **Influentials**, this is what we ask of you to deliver, create a react application that shows an overview of campaigns.

We've created a mock API endpoint from our Postman documentation that you can use to grab data to populate this overview.
